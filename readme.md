# hw 4

Broke up work into a few branches. 

    - First branch was a try to do the code from scratch and I was successful with the user interface but when it came to implementing faker I ran into a lot of errors. 

    - Second branch I start fresh with the professors code, ran everything. 

    - Third branch I change main.py to have a different user interface when using the calculator app. I also made the history from the results of the calculator return in a list this we we see all transactions in that session.

    - 4th branch I added new functionality to the calculator which is exponenets and radical expression. This was a nice way to learn about how to add onto the code but also to learn how to set up the faker library for those extra functionalities. These tests are in test_calculator.py which I added a lot more test asserts. 
        - only problem so far is handling the radicals because if I make the results decimal it throws more errors. For now I just have it round to the nearest whole number
